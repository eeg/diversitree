    <h2>Large clades</h2>
    <p class="question">Q: I have really large clades (say 1000+
    species); is there any way that I can use the "unresolved clade
    BiSSE" with my tree?</p>

    <p>
      I don't think that the approach that I use for the unresolved
      clades will scale to any more than about 200 species (even at
      that limit, it can be pretty poorly behaved).  There are a
      couple of reasons for this:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the time requirements grow exponentially (from memory
      space grows something like n^4, which is pretty nasty,
      too). Basically, this means that even if you could find the
      computational power to do a clade of size n, a clade of size n+1
      could take a thousand years, perhaps.  This is the bane of a
      huge number of computational problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, and more subtly, there is a machine precision issue.
      Floating point arithmetic can be unreliable for numbers smaller
      than about 1e-8, and totally useless for numbers smaller than
      1e-15 (try <code>(1 + 1e-16) - 1</code> in R on most platforms
      to see what I mean).  Because you are spreading a single unit of
      probability over an increasingly large space, a huge number of
      the cells (almost certainly including the one that you end up
      caring about) will be these really unreliable numbers. I've seen
      this creep in for clades that are smaller than 200 species where
      there is moderate extinction rates.
    </p>

    <h2>Positive log-likelihood values</h2>
    <p class="question">Q: I am getting positive log likelihood
    values!  I thought that log likelihoods had to be negative - is
    this a problem with my tree or with diversitree?</p>

    <p>
      The log likelihood is just <i>proportional</i> to the
      probability of observing the data, up to some unknown
      normalising constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      For BiSSE-style models, these generally arise in trees that have
      a very short root-tip distance.  This means that per unit tree
      time the speciation rates must be very large (on the order of
      log(<i>N</i>)/<i>t</i>) for a tree with <i>N</i> tips and
      root-tip distance <i>t</i>.  At each node, the conditional
      likelihoods are multiplied by the speciation rates, so there is
      a multiplication by (<i>(N-1)&lambda;</i>).
    </p>

    <p>
      If these bother you, just multiply the branch lengths of your
      tree:
    </p>
    <pre>
         phy$edge.length &lt;- phy$edge.length * 100
    </pre>
    <p>
      The estimated rates will now be a factor of 100 smaller, and the
      log likelihoods will probably be negative.
    </p>

    <h2>deSolve version</h2>
    <p class="question">
      Q: I get this warning message when running diversitree:
    </p>

    <pre>
         Warning message:
         In make.ode(derivs, dll, initfunc, neq, safe) :
         diversitree is not known to work with deSolve>   X.XX.X
         falling back on slow version</pre>
    <p class="question">
      It does seem to run slow. Is there a solution to this, and is
      this why it is running slow?
    </p>

    <p>
      This error message appears whenever the installed deSolve
      version is more recent than the current diversitree.
    </p>

    <p>
      deSolve's ode solvers look up the memory address of the derivative
      functions every time they are evaluated.  This is a nontrivial
      operation, and happens for every branch on a tree -- thousands of
      times during an ML search or MCMC chain.  To get around this, I use
      non-exported Fortran functions in deSolve directly, and remember the
      address of the derivative functions after the first lookup.  However,
      if the definitions of these change R will crash (not an error, but a
      complete crash).  When the deSolve version is not known to work, this
      caching is skipped, and the calculations slow down.
    </p>

    <p>
    To work around this problem, there are two options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Downgrade to the previous deSolve version indicated in the
      warning message.  Older versions can be installed from this <a
      href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/deSolve/">source
      archive</a>.</li>
      <li>For Linux and OSX users, pass <code>method="CVODES"</code>
      to the make.xxx function to use a different backend.  This
      does not work on windows.</li>
    </ol>
