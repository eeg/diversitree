	* R/simulation.R (tree.bisse): Fix to tree simulation code to
	store node states.  This requires fix to ape's drop.tip function.

	* R/util.R (invert): New function invert for returning the inverse
	of the log-likelihood.

	* R/model-bd.R: Simple birth-death process estimation.  This does
	not yet allow for sampling fractions or unresolved clades, but
	these will be added soon.  MLE routines are also included.

	* R/model-mkn.R: Simple Mk2/Mk-n discrete character evolution.
	This directly duplicates the 'ace' function in ape, but should
	allow some additional flexibility.

	* R/find.mle.R (find.mle.bisse): Removed default 'lower'
	specificiation as this was causing more confusion than helping
	anybody.  Using fail.value will get around more problems,
	including invalid models because of invalid lower/upper.  This may
	cause some problems where a hard lower bound is preferred to get
	exact solutions.

	* R/mcmc.R (mcmc): Added checking that the initial position has
	positive probability.  Also added 'verbose' flag to make MCMC
	searches quieter.

	* R/model-bisse.R (branches.bisse): Recursive algorithm to reduce
	the probability of numerical underflow along unlikely branches.
	This will overflow the stack sometimes though.

	* General: rewrite of the calculation functions to allow new
	models to be more easily developed.  This may cause a slight
	slowdown, unfortunately.

	* R/util.R (protect): Switch from trySilent to try(...,
	silent=TRUE) in anticipation of R 2.10's deprecation of
	trySilent.

	* R/util.R (make.ode): Fixed bug that caused integration to fail
	with deSolve version 1.5 (added 'flist' parameter).

2009-10-14  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* New formula-based constraint interface (through function
	constrain())

	* Subplex available to do ML searches

	* Standard error estimates on ML estimates
