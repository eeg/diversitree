	* DESCRIPTION: updated to version 0.4-3

	* R/constrain.R: Now allows "extra" variables to be specified,
	allowing constraint against dummy parameters.  New "update" method
	for removing constraints (adding constraints will come soon).
	constrained functions now have attribute "func" containing the
	original unconstrained function.

	* R/diversitree-branches.R: New check for appropriate length for
	root.p.

	* R/mcmc.R: Better handling of fail values.

	* R/mle.R: coef.fit.mle for constrained models can now return
	coefficients for the underlying full model (with full=TRUE).

	* R/model-bd.R: New starting.point.bd function

	* R/model-bisse.R: starting.point.bisse uses starting.point.bd

	* R/util.R: protect() now takes a default value for failure.

	* DESCRIPTION: Now depends on subplex

	* NAMESPACE: export new methods for fit.mle objects (coef and
	extractAIC), plus constants ROOT.*

	* R/clade-tree-plot.R: Fixed (was broken after importing
	plot2.R).  Now uses node.depth and node.depth.edgelength from
	plot2.R, but uses different version of node.height that allows for
	the number of taxa represented at a tip to affect spacing.

	* R/constrain.R (constrain): now allows 'formulae' object
	including a list of constraints.

	* R/mcmc.R: Removed partially-implemented options for functions
	that do not return proper log-likelihoods.

	* R/mle.R: Optional supression of warnings when guessing a
	constrained starting position.  New extractAIC.fit.mle method.
	Option for (mostly unchecked) sequential likelihood ratio tests
	for sequentially nested models.

	* R/model-bd.R (make.yule): Cannot (yet) use a prior with the Yule
	model: warning added.

	* R/model-bisse.R (starting.point.bisse): Improved to start the
	search from a yule model first, removing the need to include a
	starting point.

	* R/model-mkn.R: make.mkn() was broken (did not pass k through to
	make.cache.mkn()).  argnames.mkn() now takes optional 'k' argument
	for generating argument names manually (may change in future).

	* R/profiles-plot.R (profiles.plot): Number of breaks in a plot
	now tunable in argument.

	* R/util.R (make.ode): Now compatible with deSolve-1.6.

	* man/make.bisse.Rd: typo

	* man/simulate.Rd: small clarifications.

2010-01-05  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/simulate-bisse.R (make.tree.bisse): Fixed creation of empty
	history objects.

	* R/history.R (plot.history.coords): Fixed plotting history
	objects where nothing happened.

	* R/simulation.R (prune.hist): Fix for history plotting where
	changes occur along a branch leading to the reconstructed root
	when the branch is erased by extinction.

	* R/mle.R: Moved do.mle.search around to make file easier to
	navigate.  New coef.fit.mle method for extracting parameters from
	ML fits.

	* R/model-bd.R: Renamed bd.ll -> ll.bd for consistency with other
	functions.

	* R/model-bisse.R: Reordered arguments of ll.bisse to match those
	of ll.xxsse.

2010-01-04  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/model-bisse.R (branches.unresolved.bisse): Switch
	log-compensation to the sum of variables (rather than minimum of
	variables) to avoid a crash on Linux (stack smashing) and an
	excessive number of warnings on other platforms.
	
	* R/model-bisse.R (make.branches.bisse): make.ode for the branch
	integration is now done during make.bisse.  Added new "safe"
	argument to make.bisse that selects how this should be done.
	Eventually all lsoda based likelihood functions will get a "safe"
	argument.

	* man/make.bisse.Rd: Added "safe" argument.

	* R/zzz.R: Removed .onLoad function; no longer needed with
	make.ode moved inside of make.bisse.

	* R/util.R (make.ode): Updated make.ode to work with deSolve
	version 1.6 (two new additional arguments).  The "safe" version
	now returns same data format as the unsafe version.

	* R/model-mkn.R (argnames.mk2): Fixed logic around argument names
	for mk2 and two-state mkn (latter now returns q12, q21)

	* R/simulate-bd.R (tree.yule): New Yule tree simulation function
	that uses the existing tree.bd with mu = 0.  Required changes also
	to R/simulation.R and man/simulation.Rd.

	* R/mle.R, R/mcmc.R and all likeihood functions: Shifted protect()
	from within every likelihood functions into the new mle interface
	and MCMC functions directly.  This removes significant code
	duplication, simplifies creation of new likelihood functions, and
	means we can always depend on fail.value existing.

	* R/model-bd.R (find.mle.yule): Added support for Yule models.
	These are nice as the ML parameters are findable analytically.

2009-12-21  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* Too many little changes to list

	* R/plot-alt.R: New plotting functions, partially duplicating
	ape's plot function to allow stochastic character map type plots
	to be drawn.  I am attempting to retain as much compatibility with
	ape as possible and only using these commands within high-level
	plots.

	* R/history.R: Functions for storing and plotting phylogenetic
	histories.  The simulation code now stores exactly when changes
	occured and can plot the full character history.

	* R/find.mle.R: Continuing to revamp the find.mle code.  Different
	back ends now abstracted (though new ones cannot be added without
	recompiling the package).  Further changes coming though.

	* R/model-mkn.R: Uses the general log-compensation feature now.

	* R/util.R: New function discretize, which is useful for binning
	continuous characters into discrete characters (possibly for
	making colour codes).  Probably will change soon.

	* man/plot.history.Rd: Documentation for histories

2009-12-02  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/simulation.R (tree.bisse): Fix to tree simulation code to
	store node states.  This requires fix to ape's drop.tip function.

2009-12-01  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/util.R (invert): New function invert for returning the inverse
	of the log-likelihood.

	* R/model-bd.R: Simple birth-death process estimation.  This does
	not yet allow for sampling fractions or unresolved clades, but
	these will be added soon.  MLE routines are also included.

	* R/model-mkn.R: Simple Mk2/Mk-n discrete character evolution.
	This directly duplicates the 'ace' function in ape, but should
	allow some additional flexibility.

	* R/find.mle.R (find.mle.bisse): Removed default 'lower'
	specificiation as this was causing more confusion than helping
	anybody.  Using fail.value will get around more problems,
	including invalid models because of invalid lower/upper.  This may
	cause some problems where a hard lower bound is preferred to get
	exact solutions.

2009-11-30  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/mcmc.R (mcmc): Added checking that the initial position has
	positive probability.  Also added 'verbose' flag to make MCMC
	searches quieter.

	* R/model-bisse.R (branches.bisse): Recursive algorithm to reduce
	the probability of numerical underflow along unlikely branches.
	This will overflow the stack sometimes though.

	* General: rewrite of the calculation functions to allow new
	models to be more easily developed.  This may cause a slight
	slowdown, unfortunately.

2009-10-22  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* R/util.R (protect): Switch from trySilent to try(...,
	silent=TRUE) in anticipation of R 2.10's deprecation of
	trySilent.

	* R/util.R (make.ode): Fixed bug that caused integration to fail
	with deSolve version 1.5 (added 'flist' parameter).

2009-10-14  Rich FitzJohn  <fitzjohn@zoology.ubc.ca>

	* New formula-based constraint interface (through function
	constrain())

	* Subplex available to do ML searches

	* Standard error estimates on ML estimates
