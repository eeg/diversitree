	simulate-classe.R
		looks good; could clean up work in test-simulator/
		slow though; would port to C, but the C version of the bisse simulator is not even functional
	write a tree.classe() wrapper for simulate-geosse.R

	classe vs bisseness (in runit-classe.R and make.classe.Rd)

	classe.split (check results against geosse.split)
	man/make.classe.split.Rd
	R/model-classe-split.R

	classe.multistate (model-classe.R, in simulate-classe.R, maybe check.R)

all models
	? argument to stationary.freq.*sse() to return something more informative than NA when there are multiple solutions (as happens under irreversibility)
