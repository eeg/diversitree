background tree 0:
	equal rates for the two regions
	SimTreeSDD simpar.dat

foreground tree 1:
	more rapid speciation in A
	SimTreeSDD simpar.dat birth0=1.5, birth1=0.5 end_t=3

foreground tree 2:
	more rapid dispersal from B to A
	SimTreeSDD simpar.dat alpha=0.5 beta=1.5 end_t=3

So 1 and 2 should have more A species than 0, but for different reasons.
This will be too many parameters to estimate, so only let sA, sB, dA, dB differ between clades.
