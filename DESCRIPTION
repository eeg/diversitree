Description: Contains a number of comparative phylogenetic methods,
  mostly focussing on analysing diversification and character
  evolution.  Contains implementations of BiSSE (Binary State
  Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al. 2007: Syst. Biol. 56:
  701) and its unresolved tree extensions (FitzJohn et al. 2009:
  Syst. Biol. 58: 595), MuSSE (Multiple State Speciation and
  Extinction).  A future version will contain a quantitative trait
  method (QuaSSE; FitzJohn 2010: Syst. Biol. in press).  Other
  included methods include Markov models of discrete and continuous
  trait evolution and constant rate speciation and extinction.
