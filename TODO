* simulation: 
Add support for evolving mk2 conditional on a tree

Track exact change positions for use with the stochastic character
mapping.

Tidy up the clade tree stuff

* documentation:
Examples for most things need adding / tweaking - some run too long,
others are not implemented

find.mle has changed a lot and the documentation is lagging: there are
a *lot* of ... arguments that need describing.  The 'hessian' argument
should be added, I think.

* musse
find.mle.musse - not yet written
