When cherry-picking changes for pull-intended branches, watch out for diversitree -> diversitreeEEG.  Especially in these files:
	diversitree/DESCRIPTION
	diversitree/NAMESPACE
	diversitree-tests/run_tests.R
	diversitree-tests/runit-classe.R

doc/
	update geosse section of tutorial
		simulator
		combine
	create classe section for tutorial
	break these sections out from diversitree-tutorial.Rnw?  would speed up test compilations

classe
	simulator is slow
		try profiling -- maybe index management is slowing things down
		compare to musse
		eventually port to C, but now even the C version of the bisse simulator is non-functional

	diversitree-tests/runit-classe.R
		compare with bisseness

	diversitree/man/make.classe.Rd
		in \examples, also show relation to bisseness
		in \examples, touch up pars, pars.g

	helper functions to deal with many states
		arranging parameters
		constraining models

	classe-split
		man/make.classe.split.Rd
		R/model-classe-split.R
		will require change to param structure passed to stationary.freqs?
		check against musse, bisseness, geosse

	classe-multistate
		see equivalent for musse

all models
	? argument to stationary.freq.*sse() to return something more informative than NA when there are multiple solutions (as happens under irreversibility)

consolidate testing work
	diversitree-tests/eeg-misc on eeg-dev branch
	if many tree files, link to directory not on github
	bring in some of old Exclude/ ?
