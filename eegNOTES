When cherry-picking changes for pull-intended branches, watch out for diversitree -> diversitreeEEG.  Especially in these files:
	diversitree/DESCRIPTION
	diversitree/NAMESPACE
	diversitree-tests/run_tests.R
	diversitree-tests/runit-classe.R

doc/
	update geosse section of tutorial
		simulator
		combine
	create classe section for tutorial
	break these sections out from diversitree-tutorial.Rnw?  would speed up test compilations

classe
	simulator
		send classe-sim branch to Rich
		it's slow -- eventually port to C, but now the C version of the bisse simulator is not even functional
			compare running times with musse simulator, before complaining

	diversitree-tests/runit-classe.R
		compare with bisseness

	diversitree/man/make.classe.Rd
		in \examples, also show relation to bisseness

	helper functions to deal with many states
		arranging parameters
		constraining models

	classe-split
		man/make.classe.split.Rd
		R/model-classe-split.R
		will require change to param structure passed to stationary.freqs?
		check against musse, bisseness, geosse

	classe-multistate
		see equivalent for musse

geosse
	write a tree.classe() wrapper for simulate-geosse.R

all models
	? argument to stationary.freq.*sse() to return something more informative than NA when there are multiple solutions (as happens under irreversibility)

consolidate testing work
	old Exclude/
	maybe not even under github; or could keep on this eeg-dev branch if not huge (put simulated trees elsewhere?)
